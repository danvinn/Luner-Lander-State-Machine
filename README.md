### Using a State Machine in the Context of a Lunar Lander

For a lunar lander, a state machine can manage the sequence of operations needed to land on the moon safely. Here’s how a state machine might be used in simple terms:

**1. Deployed in Orbit (State):**

- The lunar lander is in orbit around the moon. This state remains active until the lander begins its descent.

**2. Descend (State):**

- The lander initiates the descent to the moon's surface. This would involve a series of operations like firing thrusters to decrease the orbit altitude.

**3. Engine Cut Off (State):**

- As the lander reaches close to the moon’s surface, say 30 meters above, the engines need to be cut off to prepare for a soft landing.

**4. Landed (State):**

- The final state where the lander has touched down on the moon's surface.

**Events and Transitions:**

- **Initiate Descent (Event):** Triggered by the mission control or an onboard computer decision, moving the lander from "Deployed in Orbit" to "Descend."
- **Altitude Check (Event):** Once the lander reaches a predetermined altitude, this triggers a transition from "Descend" to "Engine Cut Off."
- **Touchdown Detected (Event):** Sensors detect that the lander has landed, transitioning it to the "Landed" state.

### Why Use a State Machine?

A state machine is particularly useful for the lunar lander scenario because it clearly defines what the lander should be doing at each step of the descent and landing process. It helps in:

- **Managing Complex Conditions:** By breaking down the landing process into manageable states.
- **Ensuring Safe Operations:** By explicitly handling transitions and actions that must be performed in each state.
- **Improving Fault Detection:** By monitoring the expected sequence of states and detecting when something does not proceed as planned, thus initiating corrective actions.
## Features

- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the `LunarLanderContext` that manages state transitions and the database connection.
- **State Pattern**: Uses various state classes to handle different operational phases like power checks and system diagnostics.
- **Database Logging**: Logs all transitions and system checks into a SQLite database to record the operations for later analysis.
- **Transition Management**: Dynamically changes states based on the results of operational checks, aiding in robust mission control.
- **Error Handling**: Manages database connections properly to prevent resource leaks and ensure data integrity.
